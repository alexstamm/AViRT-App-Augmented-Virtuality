# AViRT-App-Augmented-Virtuality
This project looks into creating an augmented virtuality previsualization system to empower indie filmmakers during the onset production process. Indie directors are currently unable to previsualize their virtual set without the funds to pay for a high-fidelity
3D visualization system. Our team has created a pre-visualization
prototype that allows independent filmmakers to perform
augmented virtuality by placing actors into a computer-generated
3D environment for the purposes of virtual production. After
performing our preliminary usability research, we have determined
a clear and effective 3D interface for film directors to use during
the production process. The implication for this research sets the
groundwork for building a pre-visualization system for on-set
production that satisfies independent and emerging filmmakers.
